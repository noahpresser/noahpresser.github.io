                    Immersed Games is a startup local to Gainesville, FL, that focuses on the production of educational video games.  I interned for Immersed Games starting in early Spring 2015 through Fall 2015. I worked in programming the AI of different creatures (animals and plants) in the  game, Tyto Ecology.
                    <br><br>In my time at immersed, I developed skills such as

                    I worked at SpinCore technologies as an engineer. Spincore is a company that manufactures and sells pulse generators, located in Gainesville, Florida.  I learned about pulse generators, took inventories, and responded to customers via email about purchases, and technical support.

                    I worked with a senior programmer, Steven Spungin, on a confidential Project. I Worked in an Agile environment with Java, Gradle, and Groovy to develop an android plugin in IntelliJ. Aside from that, I cannot share information about the work I did.

                Pocket Capture Calculator is an application I built, using Unity, for Pokémon gamers.  Using the app, a player can determine his probability of capturing a Pokémon. It currently functions for all games in generation I through VI (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, for those of you counting).

                Using VR, our group simulated artwork created by James Turrell.  James Turrell's work involves manipulating light to display various illusions.  This project is unique because, aside from viewing it in VR, Turrell's work is very fleeting.  The exhibit is seasonal and seen only in a few museums worldwide.

                In another group project done in VR, this experience places you in a situation where you are confronted with a series of decisions.  The outcome changes based on which decisions you make.  You may find yourself regretting your decision to drink and drive...

                This is a personal project.  In my spare time, I have been building a first person shooter in VR.  Working on this project allows me to focus my creativity and practice creating efficient structures.  This includes a weapon system, enemy system, and more.  I have nothing to show for it currently, as it is a work in progress.

                        <br>Since a young age, I enjoyed games and was always fascinated by AI. My favorite series is the Halo series. I particularly enjoy experimenting with the enemy AI. I play games very analytically, often trying to figure out certain patterns and how different things work.

                        <br>While I'm not particularly skilled (I've never taken any lessons), I find that playing the piano is a good way to help my pattern-oriented brain relax, yet focus at the same time. I enjoy visualizing patterns on the keyboard and watching them transform into beautiful melodies.
